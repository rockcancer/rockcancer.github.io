            <p>Carl Koschmann is a pediatric neuro oncologist, father of two, and part of the original Rock Cancer team.  He took care of Vara as a training oncologist at U-M, and his original climbing sessions with Vara after completing chemotherapy planted the original seeds.  Carl represented Planet Rock and U-M Pediatric Oncology in a brief and disastrous run as an American Ninja Warrior applicant (video here). He loves belaying kids and helping with all aspects of Rock Cancer.</p>

            <p>Emily proudly stands as a member of Rock Cancer, driven by her role as a mom to a two-time Wilms survivor, Vara James. This program holds a special place in her heart as it empowers children who are battling cancer or have completed their treatments to climb, fostering a sense of accomplishment and building a supportive community. Together, we uplift these young warriors and their families, reminding them that every summit reached is a testament to their incredible strength and resilience. She loves seeing the parent's joy when their child achieves a new goal, or when they realize they are not alone.

            <p> From the moment of her Wilms Tumor diagnosis in 2016, Vara Gordon, at just 11 years old, became an advocate for pediatric cancer research. Although her battle was with a cancer localized to her kidneys, her encounter with Dr. Carl Koschmann and his pioneering lab exposed her to the pressing challenges faced by children with aggressive brain tumors. Moved by their groundbreaking efforts, Vara chose to champion the Koschmann Lab, underscoring her broad vision of fighting pediatric cancer in all its forms.</p>
